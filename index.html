                    <p id= "p1">Where to start with? Basically this entire journey was spawned from a mid mid-life crisis, I was heading nowhere with my life, my plans
                        for the futer had been slightly halted when I was constantly denied a real admission at UCSD, so it became time to adapt or waste away
                        in my mothers basement, watching anime and growing an amazing neck beard, my mother doesn't even have a basement.
                    </p>   
                    <p id= "p2">So one of the most important things I can attribute to any person that knows me is that after years of working at the restaurant 
                        that my father owns I am amazing at pot lucks. Another ofmy most amazing traits wouod bne that i have amazing references for days.
                        I've always been a huge fan of video games and comic books, as well as movies and tv, basically any medium that can be utilized to tell 
                        a good story.
